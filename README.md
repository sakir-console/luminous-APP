# luminous
Luminous is basically an android app that uses data from several open sources in order to be a complete package of everything a person needs to learn about stellar variability. Our app starts with an interactive launch button redirecting to the main navigation page - here the users can get the data of the stars right above them and control the time scale to understand and learn how those stars have evolved. After an user has completed the navigation, they can take a quiz about those stars to test their knowledge. The app has a communication tab where the users will be able to connect with others and discuss about the stars while also sharing information.

The main benefit of this app is that it is a combination of everything needed to learn. The fun, interactive features make the users learn more effectively as there's always something to keep them engaged. Thus there's a higher success rate.

With the help of our app, we hope to achieve our goal of making a "stellar-aware" society. When regular people will learn about stellar variability, they will have better understanding about the space and how things work over there. The users will have a good understanding about the researches being conducted by astronomers; they may also come up with new ideas which might later on turn into a great discoveries. Moreover, by being "stellar-aware" , the society will encourage younger generation to study about the space. Whilst many students nowadays are curious to learn more about space, there's no specific source where they are are being provided with everything in a simple way. Therefore, Luminous will be the first ever grouped source providing it all. Once the knowledge about stellar variability have been spread throughout the nations and the success rate is at it's peak, our mission will be accomplished.
